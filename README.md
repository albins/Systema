# Systema

Systema is an opinionated personal to-do list/project management system inspired by the best parts of Scrum, Bullet Journal, GTD and org-mode, implemented in Electron. It is an attempt at *finally* replacing the unwieldy, brittle, ugly mess that is the author's Org-mode configuration.

## Planned core features
- Weekly and monthly planning, with concrete goals (like Bullet Journal)
- Inboxing and refiling (like org-mode/GTD)
- Project management with sub-tasks
- Time estimation and burndown (like Scrum)
- Just plain to-do lists (like everybody)
- Sorting, filtering and prioritising tasks (like org-mode)
- Saving and managing subsets of global agendas (like nothing else)
- Recurring tasks and habits (like org-mode)

## Current status
Very, very, very, very early. Do not use.

## Distant future goals
- Desktop client synchronisation over IPFS or Secure Scuttlebutt, if they ever become stable enough to warrant the effort
- Mobile clients (whenever IPFS or Secure Scuttlebutt is mature enough to handle synchronisation to Android, or some other solution that doesn't require a server is implemented)
- Remote web access
- Google Calendar/system calendar integration?
- Progress tracking with other services (e.g. RunKeeper etc)
- Email integration
- Contextual tagging and re-activation (show some tasks only during certain times/certain locations)
